	abstract = {This paper addresses the challenges for the realisation of Functional Safety in the implementation of “Smart Manufacturing” (Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution). The use of devices connected to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a fundamental part of Smart Manufacturing to help realise the benefits of digitalisation as part of the 4th Industrial Revolution. In this paper traditional approaches to achieve Functional Safety are compared with the emerging technologies that make use of IIoT. The paper includes some examples of industrial equipment used in manufacturing that are typical of the types of machinery that will make use of IIoT, for example Collaborative Robots (Cobots), Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs), and a combination of these Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). As well as discussing the challenges the paper highlights the potential economic benefits of having the factories of the future connected to the Industrial Internet of Things.},

	abstract = {There has been an increasing popularity of industrial usage of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in parallel to advancements in connectivity and automation. Security vulnerabilities in industrial systems, which are considered less likely to be exploited in conventional closed settings, have now started to be a major concern with Industrial IoT. One of the critical components of any industrial control system turning into a target for attackers is functional safety. This vital function is not originally designed to provide protection against malicious intentional parties but only accidents and errors. In this paper, we explore a generic IoT-based smart manufacturing use-case from a combined perspective of security and functional safety, which are indeed tightly correlated. Our main contribution is the presentation of a taxonomy of threats targeting directly the critical safety function in industrial IoT applications. Besides, based on this taxonomy, we identiﬁed particular attack scenarios that might have severe impact on physical assets like manufacturing equipment, even human life and cyber-assets like availability of Industrial IoT application. Finally, we recommend some solutions to mitigate such attacks based mainly on industry standards and advanced security features of mobile communication technologies.},

	abstract = {Industrie 4.0 offers a new vision for the factories of the future. In these factories of the future safety will be critical. Functional safety addresses confidence that a piece of equipment will carry out its safety functionality when required to do so. It is an active form of safety in contrast to other forms of safety. Integrated circuits are fundamental in the implementation of functional safety and therefore to Industrie 4.0. This paper explores the implications of functional safety for Industrie 4.0. The implications include requirements for networks, security, robots/cobots and software and the semiconductors used to implement these features.},

Therefore, in the field of IoT, it is necessary to handle security and safety integrally, although these areas were treated as separate fields in the past. In the present paper, we propose a risk analysis method that can deal with both security and safety based on a safety analysis method called system-theoretic process analysis (STPA). In addition, we present a case in which the proposed method is applied to an insulin pump, which is a device for diabetic patients. In this case, using the proposed method, the occurrence of accidents due to security threats, which cannot be prevented by functional safety, could be identified. In addition, we showed a method of selecting countermeasures that can reduce the probability of the accident occurrence most among the limited budget.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently become a dominating technology which allows different “things” to communicate through the Internet and understand each other. IoT uses Artificial Intelligence techniques to process data gathered by different sensors and act accordingly. The world is now moving towards employing IoT in different disciplines such as manufacturing, agriculture, education, commercialization, smart homes, auto cars, and almost everywhere. The explosive growth of IoT is changing our world and the rapid drop in price for typical IoT components is allowing people to innovate new designs and products at home. Thus in this paper, we present the topic of “sensing” with liquids, weather, soil, smoke, and distance measures. GPS-based location acquisition is also part of several applications presented here. Sensors are used for data acquisition and IoT devices are used for data exchange through a web server. Different sensors are introduced and linked with in-house, easyto-customise and low-price IoT systems connected to mobile applications. Our paper demonstrates that IoT is powerful and ubiquitous and can be implemented in large-scale applications including managing liquids, controlling the stocks, building alarm systems, smart home control, smart irrigation, and alike.},

In this paper, we summarize the latest developments of applicationspeciﬁc IoTs (ASIoTs) (a term to conceptualize the development of IoTs targeted toward speciﬁc domains, communications mediums, and industry sectors) in eight representative studies (Internet of Battleﬁeld Things (IoBT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Internet of Animal Things (IoAT), Internet of Waste Things (IoWT), Internet of Underwater Things (IoUWT), Internet of Underground Things (IoUGT), Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), and Internet of Mobile Things (IoMobT) such as the Internet of Vehicles). The paper gives contributions to ASIoTs from three perspectives: First, we offer a basic classiﬁcation taxonomy for ASIoTs and discuss various representative studies and applications which can be found in the literature; Second, we discuss a use case for a biometrics-based ASIoT (termed IoBioT) for illustration and experiments of face-based biometric recognition on IoBioT are also performed; and Third, we give discussions and future directions for ASIoTs. An objective of this paper is to spur researchers and facilitate the development of ASIoTs for the different user-deﬁned domains, communication mediums, and technology constrained platforms.},
